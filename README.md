# CIS-3120-Spotify-Analysis

We will be analyzing Spotify's catalog data for our project. We will use Spotify's API and various web scraping tools togather, summarize and analyze Spotify's data. We also will use whatever data Spotify makes public. We will do exploratory analysis to look at popular songs, user playlists, and other information to build reports and analyze what songs and artists are most popular.  We will also visualize our findings.
